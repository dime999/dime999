# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! üëã

## About Me
üëã Hi there! I‚Äôm Adem, a 26-year-old software engineer from Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina. I graduated with a degree in Information Technologies and started my professional journey in early 2022 as a .NET developer.

üöÄ Over time, I transitioned into a full-stack developer role by expanding my skills into Vue.js. I‚Äôve been involved not only in development but also in planning, task estimation, and mentoring junior colleagues. Today, I‚Äôm working at comparis.ch as a full-stack developer, primarily using .NET and Next.js (React).

‚òÅÔ∏è I have a strong grasp of Azure Cloud infrastructure and GitHub Actions, and I‚Äôm currently diving deeper into the Azure ecosystem ‚Äî especially Azure Functions and Event Grid. In my free time, I‚Äôm also exploring Kubernetes and Dockerization to broaden my DevOps and cloud-native knowledge.

üì± During my studies, I worked with Flutter and developed my first serious project, eStomatolog, a dental clinic management app. You can read more about it in the dedicated section: ‚ÄúI am a proud engineer who created eStomatolog.‚Äù

I am proud of my project eStomatolog. The project consists of three applications: desktop, mobile, and web applications. The desktop application serves as an administration panel for doctors to manage all scheduled appointments, add new patients, doctors, and clinics. The mobile application is designed for patients, allowing them to view appointments, purchase gift cards, schedule appointments with doctors, and leave feedback. The web application serves as an informational platform about the project. For the backend, .NET and microservices were utilized along with RabbitMQ for communication. The API project is well-refined.
