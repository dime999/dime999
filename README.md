## About Me
I am a 24-year-old software engineer. 
As part of my job, I perform all
activities related to software engineering. I gained experience with .NET
by working on independent projects a year before my first job. After
that, I have accumulated 2 years of professional experience, totaling 3
years in the field. 
I got the opportunity to become a full-stack developer
and thus gained experience in Vue.js. 
In my free time over the years, I
have been learning Angular and Flutter, so I am ready to start building
projects with these technologies.
I also have a deep understanding of SQL Server and database management.
