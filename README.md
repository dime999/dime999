#Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 👋

##About Me
👋 Hi! I’m Adem, a 26-year-old software engineer from Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina. I hold a degree in Information Technologies and began my professional journey in early 2022 as a .NET developer.

🚀 Over time, I expanded my skills into Vue.js and transitioned into a full-stack developer role. I’ve also been involved in planning, estimations, and later on, mentoring junior colleagues. Currently, I work at comparis.ch as a full-stack developer, focusing on .NET and Next.js (React).

☁️ I have solid experience with Azure Cloud infrastructure and GitHub Actions. Lately, I've been exploring Azure in depth — with a special focus on Azure Functions and Event Grid. In my free time, I’m also learning more about Kubernetes and Docker to enhance my DevOps skillset.

📱 During my university years, I developed my first major project using Flutter — eStomatolog, a dental clinic management app. You can read more about it below.

The project consists of three applications: desktop, mobile, and web applications. The desktop application serves as an administration panel for doctors to manage all scheduled appointments, add new patients, doctors, and clinics. The mobile application is designed for patients, allowing them to view appointments, purchase gift cards, schedule appointments with doctors, and leave feedback. The web application serves as an informational platform about the project. For the backend, .NET and microservices were utilized along with RabbitMQ for communication. The API project is well-refined.
